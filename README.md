# AI-Powered Document Intelligence Engine
This project is a comprehensive application designed to process documents, generate AI-driven insights, and provide personalized recommendations. It features a robust FastAPI backend and a modern React frontend, containerized with Docker for easy setup and deployment.

## ‚ú® Features
Document Processing: Upload and process PDF documents, with the core structure extracted for analysis.

AI-Driven Insights: Extract key information, summaries, and contextual insights from documents using advanced language models.

Personalized Recommendations: Generate relevant recommendations based on document content and user-defined personas or text selections.

Collection Management: Organize your documents into named collections for streamlined analysis.

Podcast Generation: Convert document insights into a conversational, two-speaker audio podcast.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture
The project follows a modern client-server architecture composed of two main services:

Backend (FastAPI): A Python-based API that handles all core logic, including document processing, AI model interactions, database management, and serving the API endpoints.

Frontend (React): A modern web application built with React and TypeScript, providing an interactive user interface for uploading, viewing, and analyzing documents.

Both services are containerized using Docker and orchestrated with a single Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for a unified build and run experience.

## üöÄ Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites
- Docker`

- Docker Compose

### Installation and Running
#### Clone the repository:


` git clone https://github.com/your-username/adobe-hack-2025.git`

`cd adobe-hack-2025`

#### Backend Environment Variables: 

Create a .env file in the project's root directory (where docker-compose.yml is located). Add the necessary environment variables for the services you intend to use.

- Example .env for local testing:

#### For the LLM

`LLM_PROVIDER="ollama"`

`OLLAMA_MODEL="llama3"`

#### For Text-to-Speech
`TTS_PROVIDER="local"`

#### Frontend Environment Variables: 

Create a .env file inside the frontend directory (frontend/.env) and add your Adobe Embed API key:

`VITE_ADOBE_EMBED_API_KEY=YOUR_ADOBE_EMBED_API_KEY`

(You can obtain this key from the Adobe Developer Console.)

#### Build and Run the Application:


`docker-compose up --build -d`

#### Access the Application:

Frontend: `http://localhost:8080`

Backend API Docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

- Routing: React Router DOM

### ‚ö†Ô∏è A Note on PDF Highlighting
A core goal for this project was to automatically highlight recommended sections directly within the Adobe PDF Viewer. We explored two primary methods to achieve this:

**Text-Based Search:**  Using the Adobe Embed API's built-in text search functionality.

**Annotation API:** Programmatically adding a highlight annotation using the bounding box coordinates of the section text.

Unfortunately, due to complexities in accurately mapping the extracted text coordinates to the viewer's coordinate system, we were unable to implement this feature with the reliability required for a seamless user experience within the hackathon's timeframe.

As a fallback, the application currently alerts the user that the highlighting feature is not yet functional. Implementing a robust highlighting solution is a top priority for future development.

## ü§ù Contributing
